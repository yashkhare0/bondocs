# TODO

## Inconsistencies

1. **Provider Handling**: The fallback logic in `llm.py` is inconsistent with the provider selection. The main detection logic first checks availability for Ollama, then falls back to other providers, but there's duplicated logic across multiple areas.

2. **Template Handling**: In `prompt.py`, there are multiple rendering functions (`render_prompt`, `render_runbook_prompt`, `render_changelog_prompt`) with overlapping functionality and parameters.

3. **Tool Naming Convention**: Different naming patterns are used for similar functionality - `generate_patch`/`apply_patch` vs `update_changelog`/`update_runbooks`.

4. **System Prompt Parsing**: The approach to parse system prompts from markdown files with custom delimiters (`---system---`) lacks robust error handling.

## Redundancies

1. **Multiple Prompt Rendering Functions**: The `prompt.py` file has three separate rendering functions that mostly duplicate the same template logic with slightly different parameters.

2. **Configuration Loading**: Configuration is loaded repeatedly in multiple places rather than being cached. The `load()` and `get()` functions in `config.py` will re-parse the config file on every call.

3. **Detection Logic**: The provider detection and fallback logic could be simplified and made more efficient.

4. **Duplicate Template Loading**: The `_load_template()` function in `prompt.py` is called multiple times when it could be loaded once and reused.

## Bloated/Verbose Code

1. **CLI Module**: The `cli.py` file (371 lines) is significantly larger than other modules and contains lengthy template strings that could be moved to separate files.

2. **LLM Backend**: The LLM integration has excessive error handling and provider detection logic that could be refactored into smaller, more focused functions.

3. **Template Rendering**: The template rendering functions have too many optional parameters with complex conditional logic.

4. **Redundant Environment Variable Handling**: Environment variables are loaded twice - once in `config.py` and again in `llm.py`.

## Architectural Issues

1. **Tight Coupling**: The modules are tightly coupled, making the codebase less maintainable and testable.

2. **Lack of Abstraction**: Provider logic and prompt handling should be better abstracted with proper interfaces.

3. **Missing Type Hints**: Some functions lack proper type annotations, particularly in error handling paths.

4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Error handling approaches vary across different modules (some use exceptions, others return boolean values).

## Recommended Improvements

1. Create a more consistent provider interface with proper dependency injection
2. Consolidate template rendering into a single, flexible function
3. Implement a caching layer for configuration loading
4. Move lengthy template strings to separate files
5. Refactor the CLI module into smaller, more focused command handlers
6. Standardize error handling approach across modules
7. Improve type annotations and docstrings for better maintainability

Would you like me to provide more detailed recommendations for any particular area?
